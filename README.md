# Pro Furry MIT License

### [READ LICENSE TEXT](./LICENSE)

---

I love Open Source, and I want to give my software away to as many people as
possible. However, people hate furries for no reason and i want to fix that

If you like furries, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about. I will not pursue any legal claims against
you, even if my license text is (extremely) poorly written.

If that is not enough for your organization, I can personally grant you an
unmodified MIT license. Please follow these steps:
