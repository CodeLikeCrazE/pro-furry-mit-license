# Anti-Fascist MIT License

> MIT license with additional text to prohibit use by fascists

### [READ LICENSE TEXT](./LICENSE)

---

I love Open Source, and I want to give my software away to as many people as
possible. However, I refuse to let my work benefit those who support fascism.

If you are not a fascist and don't actively support any fascists, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about. I will not pursue any legal claims against
you, even if my license text is poorly written.

If that is not enough for your organization, I can personally grant you an
unmodified MIT license. Please follow these steps:

- Donate $500 (or more) to one of the following organizations:
  - [Refuse Fascism](https://refusefascism.org/donate/)
  - [RAICES](http://www.raicestexas.org)
  - [Democratic Socialists of America](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/donation)
  - [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/donate-aclu)
- Email "antifa-license@thejameskyle.com" with a receipt for your donation
