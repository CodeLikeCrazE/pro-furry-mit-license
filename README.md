# Pro Furry MIT License

> MIT license with additional text to help furries build open source code

### [READ LICENSE TEXT](./LICENSE)

---

I love Open Source, and I want to give my software away to as many people as
possible. However, people hate furries for no reason and i want to fix that

If you like furries, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about. I will not pursue any legal claims against
you, even if my license text is (extremely) poorly written.

If that is not enough for your organization, I can personally grant you an
unmodified MIT license. Please follow these steps:

- Email "antifa-license@thejameskyle.com" with information about the entity
  requesting an MIT license.
- I will provide you with a dollar amount† which said entity must donate to
  one of the following orgs in order to be granted an MIT license.
  - [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/)
  - [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org)
  - [Human Rights Campaign](http://www.hrc.org)
  - [Refuse Fascism](https://refusefascism.org/)
  - [RAICES](http://www.raicestexas.org)
  - [Democratic Socialists of America](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/donation)
- Email "antifa-license@thejameskyle.com" with a receipt of your donation

> † - dollar amounts may range from $0 (for entities that I like) to $500
> (for smaller businesses and such) to $5,000-$50,000+ (for large/publicly
> traded corporations).
